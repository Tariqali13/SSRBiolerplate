If you get stuck and not sure of what to say use your monthly theme idea to find what problem are you assisting the client in solving.  You can use Vonza to amplify your voice and create a platform to reach potential clients.
        People love stories so come up with one or use a client’s success story and add in some advice.  Put together something stating what you are promoting.  It could be in an e-book, coaching program, one on one coaching session, and on and on.  In this approach you stay away from sounding to much like a sales man because many people are turned off by it.
        You may want to speak or record your promotion if you are having problems writing it.  That way you will flow more naturally and sound more genuine.  Better yet, maybe you can create a video with that promotion.
        Let me give you a warning and tell you something to prepare you for as you’re building your business.  Everyone won’t like you.  Don’t worry, that’s okay.  The truth is you can’t help everyone in the world.  There are enough people that exist for you to help them.  Plenty people could use your support and guidance.  You need to focus on the people that love the way you coach.  Converse with them, get them involved and you will see this connection develop into a customer.
        As an entrepreneur it can be lonely.
        Get a coach for yourself.  It’s okay to have help.  Partner with another in business so that you can progress.
        You need someone to bounce ideas off of and have support.  It is needed and is crucial to your success.  We are human and need people to help hold us accountable and help us manage our fears.
        See what your client sees and get an outside viewpoint of your methods.
        Last but not lease don’t over think it, just go for it!

    title: 'Finding Your Coaching Niche',
    mainHeading: `Choosing a coaching niche is an important first step to developing your online or offline coaching business. A good place to start in your coaching business is Vonza.com
    There are so many coaching niches available today that it's sometimes overwhelming on which coaching path to follow or hire. 
    You’ll come across as totally scattered to your potential clients, without a clear niche.
     
    What service can you offer in your area that no one else does? <br/> Offering general broad service is the cause that many coaches and counselors fail.  Having a hook is the thing that will distinguish you from your competitors.  If you were the same what would be the reason for them to pay out of pocket costs.  They could just use an in-network therapist.
    You’ll find that it’s difficult to write a plethora of useful information products and programs to market and sell from your website, without the range that a coaching niche provides.
     
    Don’t be average and spend your life covering all types of coaching.  Get serious about a specific coaching niche and be amazing!   Basically, your niche assists you in focusing and positions you on a path to get started! 
    How to choose your coaching niche? <br/>
    <br />
    <img style="border-radius:20px" src="${CDN_URL}/business/finding-your-coaching.fld/image002.jpg"   width="100%" alt="vonza blog" />
    <br />
    It’s not really a big deal choosing a niche.  Your niche is simply a mix of your passions, current skills, and expertise, combined with a specific area of the market you can fully understand and relate to.
 
To make it easier to read, this list has been loosely categorized. Several niches belong in multiple categories.  I’ve avoided duplicate  in order to list 150 different ideas.

These will help you find your niche

        Keep your potential client list as narrow as possible, because a broader client list might complicate things unnecessary. Thus, for a successful targeted marketing strategy, choose a specific group of potential clients that are prone to be interested in what you offer.

        Do not start any business until you’re certain that you can do something your competitor cannot do.

    Many people don’t have three square meals a day, nor a spouse, children or other luxuries of life. They move on and smile. Why do we have to be sad about the things we don’t have.
    “He who is not contented with what he has, will not be contented with what he doesn’t have.” – Socrates
    Don’t confuse contentment with settling for status quo. It’s having the sense of fulfilment as you are striving to live out your purpose.
    "But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out." 1 Timothy 6:6-7 (KJV)

Problems such as relationship troubles, anxiety, depression, body image issues, stress, grief, or unresolved issues stemming from childhood, they can help you deal with.  They can also be beneficial in managing family concerns, marriage issues, interpersonal relationships, personal development, and daily life hassles.

    title: 'Don’t Bring The Baggage To The Marriage',
    mainHeading: `Scripture Meditation: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing”
    Janet was only seventeen years old when she started dating Tyson. Their relationship was on and off for a few years. They later reconnected in college and married five years later. They picked up great jobs in their city, and everything seemed like it was going fine. 

Tyson began to notice that Janet was unhappy most of the time. He couldn’t figure out the source of her sadness. 

What Tyson didn’t realize is that Janet brought some baggage with her to the marriage. She was stuck in a soul tie relationship with her ex.   

Now, please listen to us, everyone comes into a marriage with a piece of baggage or two or three. It doesn’t matter how holy of a Christian you are; if you look carefully, you can identify a piece of baggage you need to get rid of. 

One of the reasons new relationships fail is because we’re still stuck in the old ones and don’t even know it. Soul ties are invisible bounds that wreak havoc in so many relationships and marriages. 

In our counseling office, we regularly identify soul ties as a reason many marriages suffer and some fail.

Remember, the goal of God is for you to have a strong, healthy and passionate marriage. 
<br/>
<span style="text-align:center">A healthy marriage is one that is free from baggage.</span>
<br/>
Marital statistics say that money, poor communication, and sex are the three biggest reasons why marriages end up in divorce.  We would like to present another theory, and that theory is unsolved personal issues. 

Personal issues cause more divorces than money, poor communication, and sex could ever do combined!  Although we don’t have the scientific proof to back this up, we have sat down with enough couples to identify the root of a problem.  The root will always determine the fruit. 

Your baggage might not be that of a soul tie; it might be other personal issues or even generational issues that you brought with you into the marriage. 

Let’s take the money issue for example. If someone had a bad spending habit while they were single, what do you think would happen to that habit when they married?<br/>

They bring that same money issue into the marriage. This is one of the reasons why we are very strong proponents of premarital counseling. That exposes the baggage and weakness in you so they can get fixed or healed prior to saying “I do” at the altar.

Initially, one spouse would say that the other is so bad with finances it's jeopardizing their well-being, but upon further inspection, there’s a root problem that the spouse is refusing to deal with.  That refusal to deal with the root issue causes the fruit of bad money habits to manifest. The unresolved root issue is the baggage that needs to be unpacked and sorted through in order for the money issue to be resolved.  
Marriage is a magnifier.  Whatever you don’t like about yourself or have an issue working through will eventually come to light.  You now have someone who is with you 24 hours a day who can see your faults and weaknesses as clear as day.  After a while, they will begin to express their grievances with it.  The question is, will you be mature enough to work on them or, if possible, resolve them?<br/> Personal improvement requires the precious gifts of patience and forgiveness.

        title: 'How to know you have a soul tie',
        disc: `Have you found yourself tormented by thoughts about a person, excessively wondering about them, checking on them, rehearsing times with them? If so, you have soul ties. Have you grieved over a severed relationship with someone you were once close to? If so, you have soul ties. 

        Soul ties are formed through close friendships, through vows, commitments and promises, and through physical intimacy. 
        
        Not all soul ties are bad. God wants us to have healthy relationships that build us up, provide wisdom, and give godly counsel. God will strategically bring good relationships into our lives to form healthy soul ties just like in the case of David and Jonathan. See 1 Samuel 18:1 (AMP). 
        In contrast, Satan always brings counterfeits into our lives to form unhealthy soul ties.
        
        A few ways unhealthy soul ties can be formed include:
        · Abusive relationships (physically, sexually, emotionally, verbally) <br />
        · Adulterous affairs<br />
        · Sex before marriage<br />
        · Obsessive entanglements with a person (giving them more authority in your life than you give to God)<br />
        · Controlling relationships<br />
        
        The dysfunctionality of your upbringing when left unresolved will invariably run your life into the ground. Until you deal with an issue head-on, that issue will continue to deal with you. When you realize that you have unhealthy habits, traits, behaviors, then you must get to the root of those things in order for them to truly leave your life.
        
        So, based on what you know and understand, you have to take certain steps that will allow you to deprogram yourself and then reestablish yourself as who you are supposed to be with functional and healthy habits.
        
        Now your baggage might not be a soul tie. It may be fear, anxiety, depression, lust, procrastination, addiction, laziness, self-abuse, domineering, controlling or whatever. Find your baggage. Identify your baggage before it bleeds into your relationship and causes a wreck. 
        
        Self-denial is the worst form of denial. It blinds you to your issues so they never get fixed. Please don’t be so self-righteous that you don’t see your baggage. 
        
        We want you to identify whatever baggage you carried into the marriage and get help, deliverance, prayer, or counseling to root it out.
        
        You cannot have a healthy relationship until you are healthy!

        Scripture Meditation:<br /> “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us” (Hebrews 12:1, NKJV).<br />


One of the most difficult things to do is to let go of the baggage we carry. We carried them for so long that they’ve now become a part of us.

We’ve seen couples claim a piece of baggage and make it their identity. 

One Christian man said to us the other day, “I am just an angry man.  That’s who I am, and I’ve been this way since birth.”  

But the problem is that no one was born angry. Anger is not a fruit of the Holy Spirit. Anger is a spirit, and it’s of the devil. A Christian should never have the spirit of anger in them. Also know that some spirits such as anger can be inherited and passed on from generation to generation.

Here is what Paul said in Galatians 5:22−23 (AMP): “But the fruit of the Spirit [the result of His presence within us] is love [unselfish concern for others], joy, [inner] peace, patience [not the ability to wait, but how we act while waiting], kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.”

The Christian man we are talking about lived with anger for over 40 years, and it was hard for him to let go—that’s all he knew. The problem is that marrying an angry man is a marriage from hell.   

Anger unsolved often leads to rage, verbal abuse, physical abuse, addictions, gambling or even worse.

An unhealthy partner cannot build a strong, healthy and passionate marriage. You have to be willing to change, not only for your sake but also for the sake of your spouse.

Letting go can be one of the most arduous works to do. But the results are well worth it. Often times people don’t realize that the events of their past are still raging within their hearts. These events cause a leak. There’s also the baggage that will take someone to the altar prematurely seeking fulfillment and happiness in the arms of their spouse beyond what any spouse can provide.  

Some of that baggage includes but is not limited to former unhealthy and toxic relationships, the relationship that our parents had with each other (if there was one at all), and dysfunctional personal behaviors and habits. These are all pieces of baggage that can weigh us down and put a strain on your marriage. 

Now here is the hard part: Will you let go of the baggage? <br/>

Are you willing to forgive?<br/> Are you willing to get counseling or therapy, depending on how traumatic the events were? <br/>Can you openly admit that there is some inner work that you need to do? People can easily draw the conclusion that marriage doesn’t work, but the real problem is the two people not working their inner issues for the marriage to work.

        I remember a few years ago I surprised my wife with a very nice brand new Sports Utility Vehicle for her birthday. She was ecstatic and grateful for it. Then a few weeks after that, I was chatting with her and asked her to name some of the things I have done for her that she really appreciated and made her feel special. 
        
        I was clueless as to what she would say. Her response shocked me. She started by thanking me for being a great husband and for being sensitive to her needs. Then she started naming when I would wash the dishes, help her with the kids, bring her a bouquet of flower, take the trash out, come home on time to share dinner with her and the kids … on and on, she went. I was waiting for her to name the SUV she just got, but she never did. 
        
        It’s not that she didn’t appreciate the SUV gift. Receiving gifts is important to her, but what is more important to her is the act of service. She feels loved when I perform acts of service for her or the children. 
        
        My wife’s primary love language is acts of service.

        Through his more than 30 years of couples counseling, Dr. Chapman has noticed specific patterns in the way partners communicate—and it turns out that most of the population express and interpret love in the same five ways, according to his observations.

        Uyi and I entered marriage with deep emotional wounds and selfish expectations. We didn’t know that marriage wasn’t about an individual getting all their needs met at the expense of the other. 

As we look back now, we realize that at the time we married, we were both emotionally unhealthy. We were like two porcupines trying to love each other. The closer we got, the more we hurt each other.

Thirteen years in, thank God we have grown so well together that now we have a strong, healthy and a passionate marriage.

We are truly living a marriage from heaven, and we believe that you can experience that too. That’s why we wrote this book to help individuals and couples like you.

We are designed by God to love our spouse passionately, permanently, intimately, totally and unconditionally.

As pastors, we understand that a church cannot grow beyond the emotional health of its pastor, and we believe the same is true for a marriage: your relationship with your spouse will never exceed your individual emotional health.

It is very sad to note that most churches shy away from topics of emotional health. 

If you are happy in your marriage, you will be happy. But if you are not happy in your marriage, it does not matter what else is good in your life. You will not be happy, and then you will make everyone around you unhappy.

When divorcing couples go before a judge, it is common to hear them cite irreconcilable differences as the reason for their divorce. Yet, the truth is that most divorces are as a result of emotional unhealthiness in one or both partners.   

Marriage will test your emotional health and strength like no other.

There will be days when your spouse will push you to the extreme—either by their words, attitude, action or behavior. But because you are emotionally healthy and have dropped those baggage, you can handle the situation much better than others.  

Please note that emotional healthiness takes time. It always takes patience and experience in knowing how to read, understand and love your mate.

Today, our marriage is blessed. We are in love with each other. We lead a peaceful, joyful and strong marriage. But it didn’t happen overnight. It took months and months of prayer and working on us to get here. 

Uyi: “One of the areas of my emotional unhealthiness in the early days of our marriage was that I shut down when I disagreed or was upset with my wife. I would not say a word, would not look at her, and try to distance myself as much as I could for sometimes days in a stretch. 

“I took disagreement as personal rejection (a sign of emotional unhealthiness). When things didn’t go my way at church or the office, I brought it home and kept a horrible attitude around the house.”

God wants to use your scars and pain to heal your life, marriage and help other people. Will you let Him change you today so that your marriage can be healthy? Then it begins by realizing that healing is a partnership and a process, not just a one-time event.

May God give us the grace to develop marriages that are a sign and wonder, marriages that point to Jesus and offer a visible picture of the depth of God’s love for the world.

A soul tie is an emotional bond or connection that unites you with someone else in your past or present. You can become bound to a person through your soul.

    title: 'Got Trust Issues? (How to Overcome Them)',
    mainHeading: `There’s an old age saying “if there's no trust there is no relationship”. This is a true saying though very general and vague.
    One of the core foundations in marriage is trust.  Without it sporadic and unhealthy behaviors, jealousy, short temperaments, begin to surface and cause immediate damage of a marriage.
    Imagine marriage as a piece of pottery and someone kept tapping the pot with a metal hammer over and over.  Fragments would fly away until the pot started to crack and once the crack is deep enough a single tap will cause the pot to shatter.
    Your relationship is similar to that pot and trust strengthens every relationship. Although the cause of trust issues varies from infidelity, perceived lies, bad financial decisions, unfulfilled promises and the list goes on, one factor in overcoming trust issues is to learn what your spouse deems as relevant or important. Without gaining an understanding it will be extremely difficult to rebuild and be able to regain trust.
    You have to ask yourself the following questions to gain a more in depth understanding.  `,

        In the book “21 ways to ignite passion and intimacy into your marriage”, it discusses activities to help couples come back together again and refocus on the things that truly matter.
        When both parties are willing to work past issues that’s when rebuilding trust can happen. There also has to be some sort of hope within your heart to work together with the person that betrayed your trust.
        Hope gives way for the belief that though things are shaky now the relationship can and will get better.
        In order for any relationship to function properly it takes work, effort and hope without those things there is no relationship.

        The relationship will flourish and bring more happiness when it is treated with loving care and the attention that it deserves. 
        Now if you are dealing with issues within your marriage that are beyond you scope of resolution or your spouse’s scope then you should seek professional assistance from a marriage coach or counselor.
        No one is prepared for the responsibilities or the weight of marriage but outside help can you tips to enjoy marriage and it’s great benefits.  Know that the process may be challenging and will yield great rewards so have patience and trust the process.

Keep in mind you don’t have to be perfect you just have to start.  Once you start don’t stop.  Use all the things life throws at you to propel you to your destiny.

He wrote down his vision and was determined to get it done.  Look at what the vision of one man did.

        One of the mindsets you will learn from rich people is that money works for them not us working for money.  When you work for money you become a slave to it.  You have to believe that it is a tool used to get you the things you need and desire.  When you start seeing that you are in control and money works for you, you will free up the stress that comes with working for money.

Rich people don’t think about losing money or how much they need money to pay for this bill and that bill.  They don’t sit and wonder if there is enough in the bank account.  They find ways to grow their money.  

Money is here for us as a currency to exchange for services or things we need.   When you understand that you are not controlled by money you will find things you can do to get money.  In other words as you solve problems for others they are willing to pay you.  We all have skills and abilities that we can use to solve others problems.  That’s how you make money work for you.  Take time discover those skills and start doing more of those things.  What things do your friends and family run to you for? <br/> That’s your key to making money work for you.  

Vonza specializes in creating a platform where you can use your talents, create courses, and get paid.  You see?<br/>  Money works for you not the other way around.

Clearing up debt is a great thing to ad in your financial goal setting.  You want to clear up money that you are paying to other companies.  This is money you can invest in accomplishing your goals rather than accomplishing goals of the mortgage company, auto dealer, credit card companies, etc.  When you are making mortgage payments for instance put in your plan to pay more toward the principle than the interest.  

Now I’m not talking about rolling debt like utilities or cell phone bills.  Although you can find ways to reduce those bills.  Then take the money you save and put it toward your financial goals.  Things like credit cards, car loans, or any loans.  The quicker you pay them off the more money will be saved.  The more you save, the more you will have in accomplishing your goals.

Investing is how you will grow your money.  Let’s face it, without earning money from your money you won’t become rich.  Think about it you earn little to no interests on your savings accounts from banks.  They actually take your money and get investments themselves.  That’s another topic in itself.

You want to do some research and find some type of investment where you can get more return on your money.  Stock, mutual funds, and things like that can increase your money.  There are many different outlets today that you can invest at whatever level you are at.  The myth is you need to already be rich.  Not true.  Just start at your level.

Also people who are rich invest in the following: <br />

<b>Invest in Charities</b> – Don’t get crazy and give what you don’t have but take take a moment to invest in other people.  Your kind acts have a way of coming back to you.  Also some charitable acts can be tax deductible.  You can use the money to go toward financial goals.  And you are helping out others.  You never know who you are helping.<br />

<b>Invest in Self Development </b> – continue to read articles and information on financial literacy.  The best way to achieve a goal is continuing to stay affluent in that area.  Since we are dealing with financial goals continue  to educate yourself on ways to make money and grow your money.  <br />

<b>Invest in Life Insurance</b> – many people inherit money.  One way you can make sure your family receives the things necessary is by leaving an inheritance.  It sounds kind of morbid but this is a way a number of people have generated riches.  They inherit money.  You just want to make sure you have the right plan in place in case something happens to you prematurely.  <br />

These are some of the habits of the wealthy.  If you want to become rich you have to think like the rich and do the things they do.  Of course you will do it in your own way, according to your goals.

She has students and students of students all over teaching music, recording music, singing, playing instruments, and on and on.

    Each day we began to age.  The metabolism in our body starts to slow down the older we get.  The ability for our bodies to repair itself and even grow begins to slow down.  Our entire body system all the way down to the new cells began to change.  This is a normal process for us to undergo.<br/><br/>

Though 40 is not old, around this age is when metabolism slows down.  So losing weight at that age becomes a little more challenging.  The same way our bodies respond in our 20’s is different when we reach 40 and up.  We have to use a different approach in losing weight.<br/><br/>

In our 20’s we could stay active to maintain our weight.  You will realize in getting older that fat will cling to you longer than when you were younger.  You have to be more direct with your weight lose strategy.  Nutrition plays a great part in dropping pounds.<br/><br/>

As you adopt healthier eating habits you will realize the benefits a proper diet has over exercise.

Believe or not millions of people are struggling with the same questions.   Not everyone admits it but the struggle is common among leaders as well.  It’s challenging to get answers about balancing work and life because there are so many varying answers. <br/>
Being married, a father, owning businesses, and a spiritual leader finding balance is difficult.  Constantly there are demands on me that require my mind and time.  Just going and going, I became addicted to working and being needed by people that I wasn’t taking time to rest.<br/>
I am improving in my ability to balance my life and I will share some tips.  Now keep in mind these are lessons I’m learning with you.  It’s imperative to me to help others find balance.  It’s crucial and I didn’t always possess it.<br/>
People constantly talk about favorite places they enjoy.   Whether it’s the beach, the park, the golf course, or the spa, they love to be there.  My office was my favorite place to be.  Because I love to work!<br/>

        I was like the Energizer Bunny I just kept going and going and going, until something happened.  My health started to suffer and one of the major things, my eye sight began to fail as well.
        I had great people around me.  My wife, family, and others closest to me pleaded for me to take time off work.  During that time I had also had dreams and would hear different messages about creating balance.  It took a while for me to listen and take the necessary steps.
        I realize that I could live a much better and happier life if I focused on balance.  I knew that I would be a better leader, husband, friend, father, and CEO when I understood balance.  I would become more productive in all areas.
        Also God inspired me to take rest.  It is a principle called the Sabbath found in the bible.
        Hebrews 4:9 "There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;" (NIV)
        The Sabbath is a day of rest, a day off, not to be confused with the day of worship.
        There are times you will need help in balancing work with your personal life.  A counselor or a coach is highly recommended.
        
        So here are five secrets to help entrepreneurs, employees, ministers, and managers obtain proper balance: <br/>

        disc: `
        The first thing in finding balance is identifying your needs.  Communicate what you really care about.  Don’t hide it or expect people to figure out what brings you balance and what satisfies you.
What’s the reason behind you working hard? <br/>  What are you trying to accomplish?<br/>  What are you avoiding or what space are you filling?<br/>  Are you seeking validation?<br/>
Does it create a false sense of security or accomplishment?<br/>
Is it an attempt to avoid home or life?<br/>
Really search yourself and be honest.  You want to identify the real reasons you work so hard.
Do you need to make more time for your family?  <br/>
What do you need?  <br/>Be transparent.  For example employees and managers must have open dialogue with each other.  There has to be communication on what is possible and what works.  This increases productivity.
Various jobs and people need to be handled differently but all benefit from conversations that are open and honest about balance.

It’s not easy but definitely required.  Plus you have to stick with it to cultivate your routine and create a more stable lifestyle.
        You have to respect your limits.  If you don’t do it, nobody else will respect those limits.

        Time is very important for quality of life.  The only thing you can’t buy more of is time.  I’ve seen many people over the years waste time on things that don’t matter.
For me my relationship with God, my family, friends, and then work are the things that matter the most.  I’ve listed them in the order that is important for me.  It is important for me to have time with God first thing in the morning.  I also prioritize time with my wife, my children, and family.
You have to prioritize what matters the most in your life. Focus on those things.  Are you just making noise or are you working on goals that will benefit your company?<br/>
Take inventory of your day and maximize on each hour, minute, and second and prioritize the important things.  This may require to plan and structure your day on a high level.

        For instance when you’re at the dinner table, leave your phone somewhere else.  Put it on vibrate or silent so you won’t be tempted to go answer it. When you’re on vacation enjoy your time and don’t be tethered to your phone.  Once you do it a few times these limits will be easier to maintain.
        Taking time to step back and disconnect will allow you to experience some of life’s greatest perspective, and treasures.  You will see that problems will more clearly be solved.
        You will recognize the ability to be more free and analytical and make less emotional decisions.  Just like our electronics need to be powered off and rebooted we need it too.  We need to be refreshed and renewed and this can only be accomplished by disconnecting from everything for a moment.

        Off days are designed to rest and rejuvenate so you can be more productive.  Fresh ideas, renewed energy, extended drive are all benefits of taking time off.

In fact that’s what not balancing your life looks like an explosion waiting to happen.  Without balance you will become married to work and not tend to the important things of life.  Your  work will not be at your funeral when you die just the people you have powered into.  Your family, your friends, and the legacy you have left.
So take time enjoy your family, your spouse, children, friends, etc and laugh and enjoy them.  Don’t do life alone! Laugh!

Work is great and can lead to a comfortable and fruitful lifestyle.  Just take time to rest and be rejuvenated.  Find balance in your personal life and work

How you feel about yourself is evident in the way you walk, talk, and look.  Whether you know it or not how you love yourself affects the way you treat people.  Loving “you” makes it easier for people to interact with you and allows them to see you can lead.

    When you have low self-esteem you tend to have poor posture.  You walk or sit slouched over or it’s difficult for you to look people in the eye.  Though you may not notice it, it sends signals to people that you are unsure, not confident, or even unauthentic.  Viewing yourself lowly will cause you to think that no one likes you.
