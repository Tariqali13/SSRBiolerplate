Please note that Vonza needs to be able to determine your identity in order to be able to respond to your request.</p>
                                            <p className="text">If you believe that any PII we are holding is incorrect or incomplete please send an email with your specific request to <a href="mailto:privacy@vonza.com">privacy@vonza.com</a>. We will work with you to make any corrections deemed necessary. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Additionally, note that registered Instructors and Students may change visibility of their respective personal information throughout our website by editing their personal profiles.</p>
                                            <p className="text">You have the right to request that Vonza restricts the processing of your PII under certain conditions. For example, if you contest the accuracy of the PII, the processing may be restricted for a period enabling Vonza to verify the accuracy of the PII or if Vonza no longer needs the PII for the purposes of the processing but you require the PII for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
                                            <p className="text">You have the right to have your PII deleted without undue delay and Vonza is obliged to delete your PII without undue delay if, for example, the PII is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed. Please note that Vonza is not obliged to delete the PII if Vonza can show that the processing is necessary, for example, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.</p>
                                            <p className="text">If you provide your email address to Vonza, you will always have the opportunity to opt out of receiving email newsletters and promotions through the unsubscribe link in the email communications or by logging into and changing the preferences for your user account. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</p>
                                            <p className="text">You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to Vonza’s processing of your PII if the processing is based on, for example, legitimate interests. If you object to such processing, Vonza will no longer be entitled to process your PII based on such legal basis, unless Vonza can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedom or if it is conducted for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.</p>
                                            <p className="text">You have, under certain conditions, the right to receive the PII concerning you and which you have provided to Vonza, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such PII to another data controller without Vonza trying to prevent this, where Vonza’s processing of your PII is based on a contract or consent and the processing is carried out by automated means. In such case you have the right to request that the PII shall be transmitted from Vonza directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>
                                            <p className="text">You also have the right to withdraw your consent, if applicable. If you withdraw your consent, please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal and that Vonza may, under certain circumstances, have another legal ground for the processing and therefore may be entitled to continue the processing.</p>
                                            <p className="text">If you would like to exercise your rights, you may contact us on the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                                            <p className="text">If you are unhappy with our processing of your PII or of an alleged infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation or other applicable data privacy laws, you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, for example in the country of your habitual residence or place of work.</p>
